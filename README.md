# Striver's DSA Challenge Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from the popular "Striver's A2Z DSA Course/Sheet". All solutions are implemented in Java.

## About This Repository

This collection serves as a personal log of progress and a practice ground for implementing various data structures and algorithms. The problems are organized thematically, mirroring the structure of the original DSA sheet, to provide a clear and structured learning path.

## Topics Covered

The repository is divided into steps and topics, making it easy to navigate to a specific problem set.

### Step 1: Learn the Basics
*   **Patterns (`step1/lec2pattern`):** Solutions for various pattern-printing problems.
*   **Basic Math (`step1/lec4basicmath`):** Implementations of fundamental mathematical algorithms like GCD, checking for prime numbers, reversing numbers, and more.
*   **Recursion (`step1/lec5recursion`):** Classic recursion problems including factorial, Fibonacci series, string reversal, and palindrome checking.
*   **Hashing (`step1/lec6hash`):** Problems solved using basic hashing techniques.

### Step 2: Sorting
*   **Basic Sorting (`step2/lec1sort`):** Implementations of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
*   **Advanced Sorting (`step2/lect2sort`):** Implementations of Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

### Step 3: Arrays
*   **Easy (`step3/lec1easy`):** Foundational array problems like finding the largest element, rotating arrays, removing duplicates, and linear search.
*   **Medium (`step3/lec2medium`):** More complex array challenges including Kadane's Algorithm for maximum subarray sum, Moore's Voting Algorithm, and stock buy/sell problems.

### Strings
*   **Easy (`string1/easy`):** Basic string manipulation problems.
*   **Medium (`string1/medium`):** Intermediate challenges like frequency counting and permutation questions.
*   **Hard (`string1/hard`):** Placeholder for advanced string problems.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository or browse the folders to find the solution for a specific problem. Each Java file is named descriptively based on the problem it solves.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-kacha/Striver-s-DSA.git
